                        “I am looking for someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging, and it's very
                        difficult
                        to
                        find anyone.'
                        I should think so — in these parts! We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures.
                        Nasty
                        disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner!”

                                Full of darkness and danger they were,
                                and sometimes you didn't want to know the end.
                                Because how could the end be happy.
                                How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad happened.
                                But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow.
                                Even darkness must pass.
                                A new day will come.
                                And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.

                                That meant something.
                                Even if you were too small to understand why.
                                But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
                                I know now.
                                Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn’t.
